### History and Evolution of Artificial Intelligence

Artificial Intelligence (AI) has its roots in philosophical inquiries into the mind and intelligence. The term 'artificial intelligence' was coined by John McCarthy in 1956 at the Dartmouth Conference. Since then, AI has evolved from simple automated programs to complex systems capable of learning and decision-making.

### Understanding AI Agents

AI agents are systems capable of perceiving their environment through sensors and acting upon it with actuators. These agents can be simple, rule-based systems or complex neural networks capable of learning from data.

**Code Examples:**

```
# Pseudo-code for a simple reflex agent
```

```
def simple_reflex_agent(percepts): if percepts == 'obstacle_ahead': return 'turn_left'

**Quizzes:**

**What do AI agents use to perceive their environment?**

- Actuators
- Sensors
- Motors

**Answer:** Sensors

### Types of AI Agents

There are several types of AI agents, categorized based on their capabilities:
1. Simple Reflex Agents
2. Model-based Reflex Agents
3. Goal-based Agents
4. Utility-based Agents

**Code Examples:**

```
# Example of a goal-based agent pseudo-code
```

```
def goal_based_agent(percepts, goals): if close_to_goal(percepts, goals): return 'act_to_achieve_goal'
```
